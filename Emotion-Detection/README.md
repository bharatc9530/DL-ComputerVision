# Emotion Detection Using Deep learning and opencv

## Image Classification model in build on Facial data to predict Happy, Sad and Neutral Emotion

## Frontal Face haar casade file is use to detect face in real time image and bounding for image is predicted

## Using opencv integrate the opencv face detection to emotion classification with Accurate and fast Real Time Predection

## For further improvement in Result it is require to collect better quality of dataset 

```
Data is Taken from Open Source available on kaggle
